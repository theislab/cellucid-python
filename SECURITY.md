# Security Policy

Cellucid takes security and privacy seriously. We appreciate responsible
disclosure and will work with you to understand, validate, and address issues.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security reports.

Preferred:
- Use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting (Security → “Report a
  vulnerability”) in the relevant repository, if available.

Alternative:
- Email the maintainer at `k.inecik@gmail.com`.

Please include:
- a clear description of the issue and potential impact,
- steps to reproduce (or a proof-of-concept),
- affected components and versions (if known),
- any suggested mitigation or fix.

## What to expect

- We aim to acknowledge reports within **2 business days**.
- We will coordinate a fix and a disclosure timeline with you.
- If you prefer, we can credit you in the advisory/release notes.

## Supported versions

We generally support the latest released version and the current `main` branch.
