# Landing / Orientation Pages (Start Here)

These pages are the fastest way to get oriented in the Cellucid web app:

- If you are new (or teaching someone else): start with the 60‑second tour.
- If you are experienced but “lost” in a new UI: jump to the UI glossary.
- If the app is slow/blank/doesn’t load: go to System requirements first.

**Recommended reading order**

1) `a_orientation/03_quick_tour_60_seconds`
2) `a_orientation/04_ui_glossary_terminology`
3) `a_orientation/05_which_workflow_is_for_me_decision_tree`
4) `a_orientation/02_system_requirements` (or sooner if anything feels “off”)
5) `a_orientation/01_what_is_cellucid` (concept + mental model)
